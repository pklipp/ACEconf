              Have you ever thought about why some Scrum and Kanban implementation works when other not? Have you ever thought about how to find the time for the process improvements when there are always too many things to do at your backlog?
              </p>
              <p>
               Dew years ago I have been performing a research about Theory of Constraints and Queuing Theory. I was looking for something that would help my measure our system maximum performance without creating performance tests. By accident, I have discovered that Theory of Constraints (TOC) stands behind almost every effective software development process. What if I will tell you that Scrum works because of TOC? What if Kanban works because of it? What if many unnamed but still well working processes works thanks to more or less conscious TOC applications? If you have never heard about Theory of Constraints I would love to share few stories with you.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                Key learning points:
                 - What is Theory of Constraint and how to apply it to any product development process?
                 - What is the main goal of every company in the world and what are the three most important success factors in every development process?
                 - How to apply Queuing Theory when looking for bottlenecks in your system ­
                 - Little's Law in practice?
                 - Why and actually how Scrum works? Based on the Math, not fluffy theories and intuition.
                 - How to use Work In Progress limits and why to use it,­ again ­no fluffy stuff, just Math?
                 - What is the Slack Time and how to convince anyone that it does make sense?
                 - How to find the time for quality?
                 - How to find time for improvements?
                 </p>

                  <p>
                  Do you want to boost your teams' velocity and effectiveness? Have you ever struggled with implementing real teamwork? Do you want to improve the delivery time of your features? 
 
                  I will also uncover the secret of how to convince anyone to use Scrum/Kanban or any other Agile/Lean process. 
                  (SPOILER ALERT: It is simple ­ they can argue with you but they can not argue Math.)
 
                  Beside of that - if you have ever struggled with managers who push too many tasks on you and your team this presentation is definitely dedicated to you too!
 
                 This talk is not in English. It is in Math.
