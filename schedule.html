							For many years studies have shown that more diverse teams are more creative and flexible and produce better solutions. Both the demand for more tech talent and basic fairness also support increased diversity and inclusion. But just as there is no single easy way to write good code there is no single easy way to increase diversity. There are, however, several things that companies and organizations do which actually work against diversity. This talk will explore these anti-patterns for diversity, including uncritical belief in meritocracy, lack of understanding of the realities of marginalization, null processes, misunderstanding of “culture fit”, and an unwillingness to change, as well as some ways that teams, companies, and organizations might work to combat them.

						Remote development teams have some huge drawbacks when it comes to understanding who the end-users are of the products created by them. Most often the product caters for a different geographical area and in a different language. This means that none of their family members or peers will ever be in touch with it, as well as them not being able to relate to it directly. A lack of understanding can lead to disengagement and decreases the developer's ownership of the product. Even more problematic, the relationship between stakeholders and developers can become one of taking orders, rather than being involved in the strategic development and ideation for the products future. This talk focusses on how you can use User Research insights to create a better understanding of the factual use of product among developers. While at the same time engaging developers in thinking about user flows and product improvements.

Every six months (so far twice) we divide into "Scrum Master Teams" to better understand our development teams and to create something that has value. Our client are our teams. 
I want to tell you what we managed to achieve and why it is important.

							Most Scrum Masters are quite fluent in "Scrum", but they lack experience in System and Complexity Thinking. Most projects don't fail because of the wrong tools, but because of people and a missing understanding about the system that we are all part of. I'll share stories about real world teams and their struggles with the system around them and talk about how a more systemic approach helped them. At the end of the talk you'll have a better understanding of system and complexity thinking and the needed mindset, as well as some tools that will help you on your systemic journey.

							We’ve spent years working on helping teams and programs visualize progress and work to get more done. In some places where flow was more of a constant, the focus switched from getting more down, to learning faster, sometime learning that what was getting done was not really needed or valuable. This talk will explore the importance of where were have been as a vehicle for where we can go. It will explore both product discovery and product delivery, examining how to blend them at a frequency that is right for the product and not driven by the process. We will look at lightweight product delivery with small independent teams as well as producing real market value when working in large scale systems. Warning: Scrum heresy will take place and open skepticism that promotes an evolution towards better progress over yet more process will be honored, amplified and cherished.

							As web professionals we’re used to hearing about the virtues of shipping fast and iterating regularly in order to meet changing needs, but how do we ensure that the projects that we’re planning now are still as relevant and robust when they launch in the future... and beyond? How do we prepare for the unknowns and constant shifts in technology; what can we do to progress the evolution of the web itself; and how do we, as individuals, ensure that our skills are as relevant as ever in this rapidly changing world? </p><p>


In this talk we’ll look at why the future is important, and past visions of the future, including those from the world of science fiction. We’ll explore what we can learn from these lessons, and how to apply this in a practical sense to the work that we do.

							As a Head of Software Dev, part of my job was to review salaries every now and then. Except I don't think I'm the right guy to do it. You may be fair in a group of 7 devs you work with, but this doesn't scale. When you have ~40 people, it's pure science fiction. So I've created a simple process of peer-to-peer review, that allows me to get salaries more or less fair, bring people some feedback, while not trying to play a semi-omnipotent judge, and which doesn't take forever.


This is a case study / tutorial, of how to optimize salaries for fairness, while being constrained by corporate rules, law, and lack of time.


It ain't perfect, but after Jurgen Appelo gave a lecture at Devoxx PL last year, one of my devs came to me happy, saying we do it right. So I guess it's not that bad either.

							I want to play a game. The game is about running a business based on creating a product for which customers pay. What I would like you to experience is: delivery pressure, customer discovery, how team influences a product, waste optimization and - maybe - defining product vision and road map. As a side effect of having fun I hope you will learn the basics of Lean Startup mindset. After the game, I would like to share with you hands-on experience of challenges a company faces when building a product and how Lean Startup combines with Scrum and DevOps.

							What is the first thing we do when a major issue occurs in a live system?  Sort it out of course.  Then we start the hunt for the person to blame so that they can suffer the appropriate punishment.  What do we do if a person is being awkward in the team and won’t agree to our ways of doing things?  Ostracise them of course, and see how long it is until they hand in their notice – problem solved. 


This talk delves into why humans have this tendency to blame and punish.  It looks at real examples of punishment within the software world and the results which were achieved.  These stories not only cover managers punishing team members but also punishment within teams and self-punishment.  We are all guilty of some of the behaviours discussed. 


This is aimed at everyone involved in software development.  After the talk attendees will understand: 
•        Why we tend to blame and punish others. 
•        The impact of self-blame. 
•        The unintended (but predictable) results from punishment. 
•        The alternatives to punishment, which get real results.

The products are doing well. But -- there is always a But. Things could be better. Something is frustrating team members or disappointing customers or slowing things down. What is it?


Friction. No matter how well things are going, there will always be friction. Consumers experience friction when using your product. Friction delays a team's response to a product request. Friction makes the code difficult to change. Differing expectations create friction among team members. Competing goals create friction between teams.


This talk looks at the most common sources of friction in software systems, and present patterns for reducing friction that can be used again -- and again -- to identify and address points of friction on an ongoing basis.

                        	This talk will cover: 
- How can we redefine leadership with the aim to build better products? 
- Case study in recruiting advocates and collaboration to ship products 
- Case study in organizing volunteers for Open Tech School and ClojureBridge coding workshops 
- Why should YOU lead? 
- How CAN you choose yourself to lead? 


After my talk the audience will be empowered to: 
- choose to be a leader, even if you're an intern 
- take actionable steps to be a good leader, even if you're working by yourself 


This is important because 
- maybe you are waiting to be promoted...but you can choose to lead today. 
- there are different styles of leadership--maybe you are a leader already and you don't know it because the style of leadership where you are working is not yours. 
- people shy away from leadership because they are wary of power. These are the exact people who should be leading! 
- we need leadership diversity! So I want more people to think about leadership and how they can lead.

							Our highest priority is to satisfy a customer through early and continuous
delivery of valuable software. Continuous attention to technical excellence and
good design enhances agility. Agile processes harness change for the
customer and deliver the competitive advantage. Agile processes promote
sustainable development.
One of several reasons why agile techniques are so effective is that they
reduce the feedback cycle between the generation of an idea and the
realisation of that idea. This not only minimises the risk of misunderstanding, it
also reduces the cost of addressing any mistakes.
But most of the times we fail to take Agile further than team level. Based on
my experience it is very hard to actually transform the companies and adopt
Agile mindset and create high performing organisations.
In this talk I will present a bunch of ideas that you can apply directly in your
daily work that will allow you to bring your company to the next level of agility
creating high performing organisation.

Have you noticed the impact when someone more senior in your organisation shares their opinion? Meet the HiPPO: the Highest Paid Person’s Opinion. Sometimes it’s subtle and unintended. Other times it’s more direct and intentional. Either way, the HiPPO is a dangerous animal in Product Development.
</p><p>
When we allow the HiPPO to drive decision-making we hide critical assumptions. Value and urgency is buried. Batch size is increased. Dates are promised. Options are prematurely closed down. False constraints back us into a corner. Costs are squeezed. The chances of discovering black swans is reduced. The risk of failure increases. Indeed, the HiPPO is one of the most dangerous animals to let stomp around in Product Development.
</p><p>
Whilst the HiPPO likes to be in charge, they don’t want to be responsible for developing products that nobody wants. How can we help the HiPPO to help themselves?
</p><p>
In this session, we will talk about: </br>
<ul>
<li>Why HiPPO is very dangerous in the product development</li>
<li>How people usually react when faced with HiPPO decisions</li>
<li>How we can minimise the HiPPO effect</li>
