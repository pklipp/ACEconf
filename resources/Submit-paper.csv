Is it possible to apply a full extent of SAFe and cover all needs of the large organization? Should we follow all the guidelines by the book or can we select only those that are the most relevant? In MeteoGroup we have faced the challenge of such transformation. During this talk, we would like to share the most interesting findings and lessons learned of two years’ journey to scaled agile that is definitely not over. During this time, we were constantly looking for improvements and reviewing our practices to cover all challenges that we are facing in large scale, distributed organization. We will mainly focus on program and team level including presenting the results of our tryouts to build future roadmap, perform remote big room planning sessions and synchronize distributed teams to deliver on time.","Konrad Swistelnicki - master of science and engineer in Information Technologies who gained his professional experience in Poland, Germany and the USA.

We’ve incorporated storytelling to share and explain the data we collect on customers, and to help us build our user engagement processes.   I would like to tell a tale of how FreeAgent incorporated narratives into our research process and use them to influence key decisions. You will also hear handy tips on how to turn data into stories within your own organisation.  As humans, we think and build our memories around stories. Our brains are hardwired for narratives and they are a powerful way to share information.   In this session I would like to demonstrate how you can harness the power of stories to help your business make meaningful decisions. You’ll learn about:  - How a compelling narrative makes information more digestible and memorable  - How anecdotes help to build a picture of users struggles by providing an emotional context to their journeys. This in turn builds rapport, leading to a decision making process that is more user focused - How engaging stories make impact and help with stakeholder buy in - How telling stories leads to better customer interview skills by teaching us to become attuned to the nuances of user stories and to gather a deeper understanding of their issues - How writing stories from data is also great for analysis, allowing us to reflect on the findings and abstract information in an emphatic way - How to stop dreading presentations and have some fun doing it - How to use structure, expressiveness and empathy to translate your data into tales.  By learning how to create effective stories you’ll have a new tool for making an impact with your data and gaining buy in from stakeholders.","Aleks is a thinker, self-proclaimed anthropologist, and an user advocate.  Her geeky tendencies and love to learn about everything and anything, have lead her to pick up a career in UX research.

Then,  you hear from stakeholders ‘we need to run a user interview’ as a way to indicate that research needs to be run. As researchers, our first response is, ‘why an interview? How do you know we need an interview?’ Stakeholders simply directing that a ‘focus group, or a ‘usability test’ be implemented need to be brought deeper into the fold beyond the buzzword. There is a better way!   In this hands on workshop, we will discuss decision-making criteria necessary to select the best method (or create a new method!) Further, we will understand various factors like interaction style, contextual considerations, mode of communication and sample size. Through pointed examples, the presenters will describe a strategic framework that has helped businesses align around research objectives, which then inform method.","Kavitha Krishnan aka lifelong champion for UX is a passionate UX professional who enjoys solving problems, organizing  information and designing interactions.

This talk will outline the concept of Context Platforms and the value of openness and extensibility.  What does Facebook, Alexa, Yelp, Airbnb, and Uber have in common? They all provide experiences that make your life easier and more enjoyable. We use platforms like these as part of our life with a very specific context in mind. At Uber, we call them Life Context Platforms. Great Context Platforms leverage a unique life context and optimize it for the best possible experience. However, the best Context Platforms also enable third-party applications to leverage that unique life context through an open and extensible ecosystem. These third-party applications, also called Agents, can be a stepping stone into a different life context. Agents allow connecting a variety of life contexts to shape the perfect, fluent user experience. For instance, a Facebook Agent for Uber would allow you to order an Uber while you connect with your friends. In your Uber, a Nest Agent could allow you to set your thermostat into economy mode. The Yelp Agent could show you reviews of the place you're headed to... That creates a magical experience!  Context Platform ecosystems serve a critical goal: Make your life context even more personal, and with that more valuable. You can choose your personal goals and infuse context information from other platforms to improve your life context experience.  Join me for a presentation about the concept of life contexts and how current platforms act as agents that fulfill your very specific, contextual goals. You will understand how life contexts should shape your experience to make your users have wow-moments!","Alexander is leading the Developer Relations team @ Uber.

We will start by obvious examples of collaboration and help within an agile team and from that we'll move to some less common ways of collaboration. We will touch many different things we can use to foster collaboration, whilst making these things by themselves more valuable - things such as meetings, arguments and tension. The main outcome of this session will be that every participant leaves with at least 1 thing he can try in his / her work starting from the next day.","Tomas has more than 10 years of experience as a software developer, team leader, senior manager and a agile coach in the banking and pharmaceuticals sectors in Prague, Czech Republic.

How many times have we pursued the latest technological bells and whistles instead of thinking why do our customers use what we are building?

This talk delves into this crucial practice, which relies on empirical, lightweight tactics for pushing cross-functional teams toward a unique digital solution that customers want. It will start with a primer covering topics such as competitive research, validated user research, value innovation, and why you must design a “killer” user experience.  Jaime will discuss her recent role in defining the UX Strategy for the futuristic international transportation system called Hyperloop. The general public's understanding of Hyperloop is that it is a high-speed rail concept originally put forth by entrepreneur Elon Musk (SpaceX, Tesla, Paypal, etc.) back in 2013. But the bigger story is that this revolutionary transportation system using pressurized capsules riding on air cushions is just a small part of the customer experience.  The ultimate goal of the Hyperloop initiative is to dramatically improve how people transport themselves either locally or globally by making the time they spend traveling more productive and cost-efficient. The “big picture” solution is a unified network of digital touchpoints where shared big data and interwoven dashboard/app interfaces are seamlessly connected across multimodal transportation systems (i.e. bikes, tuk-tuks, ride-sharing services, self-driving cars, planes and the future Hyperloop rail system).  This fundamentally required a UX strategy that sought to optimize travel for all people by disrupting outdated transportation-based mental models and introducing innovative business models. The case study illustrates how Jaime led a UX apprenticeship program for Hyperloop Transportation Technologies, a company formed using a crowd collaboration approach. Her team was charged with ideating and creating prototypes for a multitude of user experiences to help push this moonshot project forward.  What people will learn: Why an empirical practice of user experience strategy is crucial for devising digital products and customer experiences that people want Disrupting massive legacy systems requires thinking about technology and stale mental models in new ways Innovators need to set aside fears of “privacy” and ""feasibility"" in order to envision futuristic services or products for the common good of the general public and service providers How to focus teams on the primary utility and business model of the solution through competitive analysis and rapid prototyping That 20 engineering students with big data backgrounds can actually come up with UX strategy concepts if given the right direction and a lot of wiggle room for visionary thinking","Jaime Levy is an author, professor and a user experience strategist.

This presentation analyzes two cases where Large-Scale Scrum (LeSS) framework was used successfully. The first case starts already as early and December 2005 where LeSS was adopted by an organization using incremental sequential development. The second case is from 2008 - 2010 where LeSS framework was used to build a new product from scratch. Both cases handled are coming from Nokia Networks that is successfully continuing to use LeSS framework in several organizations.  The presentation focuses on several aspect that one encounters when using LeSS in large organizations. First we look organizational challenges that one encounters while using self-managing cross-functional teams that are fundamental building blocks of LeSS framework. Then we look the difficulties that organizations face when moving beyond eight teams and one person can not anymore handle the prioritization for all the teams. We are no forgetting that development practices enable scaling and focus on the everyday practices that were used in both cases.  At the end of the presentation, there is analysis from both cases where we demonstrate the common success factors that were present in both cases.","Ran is an experienced software professional who has worked since 1995 in professional software development  eld, using C, C++, and Java.

Have you ever thought about how to find the time for the process improvements when there are always too many things to do at your backlog? Dew years ago I have been performing a research about Theory of Constraints and Queuing Theory. I was looking for something that would help my measure our system maximum performance without creating performance tests. By accident, I have discovered that Theory of Constraints (TOC) stands behind almost every effective software development process. What if I will tell you that Scrum works because of TOC? What if Kanban works because of it? What if many unnamed but still well working processes works thanks to more or less conscious TOC applications? If you have never heard about Theory of Constraints I would love to share few stories with you.  Key learning points: - What is Theory of Constraint and how to apply it to any product development process? - What is the main goal of every company in the world and what are the three most important success factors in every development process? - How to apply Queuing Theory when looking for bottlenecks in your system ­ - Little's Law in practice? - Why and actually how Scrum works?

The second failure pattern: Feeding the HiPPO 7. The things we did to address subjective opinions taking the place of validated learning - Hypothesis-based development and a focus on outcomes (topics covered: Lean Startup, Impact Mapping, Visualisation & 'Selling' Lean).   8. The third failure pattern: Navigating with an Out-of-Date Map 9. The things we did to address lack of data/metrics and slow feedback loops - Initiating a move towards CD, putting Data in the hands of teams (topics covered: Continuous Delivery, giving teams access to data)  10. The fourth failure pattern: ""We're a Cross-Functional Team, and then we hand over to Ops"" 11. The things we did to address poor quality of our environments, manual and siloed release processes - putting releases in the hands of teams, putting teams on-call, integrating operations with development teams (topics covered: Continuous Delivery, Production Monitoring, DevOps, *actual* cross-functional teams, removing the Feature vs Technical Improvement debate & language)  12.

Feedback forms are everywhere, and in conversations one often gets the impression that - not only can one not not communicate, one also cannot not give feedback. Feedback is seen as an essential part of learning and developing - as an individual as well as a team. And yet, often it is an unpleasant experience, that does little (if any) good. We have all been in situations where we were overwhelmed by the difficulty of giving and of receiving feedback well... where we felt we were in well over our head.  It starts off with the seemingly simple question of “What exactly is feedback? How does it differ from advice, criticism, praise, encouragement, kudos, reflection, observation, judgement, assessment?” And it goes on with questions such as When is giving explicit feedback a good thing? When does it do more harm than good? Is it sometimes useless? What is the point of feedback? What are possible motivations behind giving feedback? Why is it important to reflect on those? How can one give valuable feedback? On a one-to-one basis and as a team What is the best way to receive feedback and evaluate it constructively.  There is a lot of insecurity surrounding the subject, a lot of myths and a lot of seemingly trivial truths and practices. In this session we want to help you take a step towards making feedback a little less uncomfortable by creating a forum where you will be given the opportunity to practice and reflect on your feedback giving and -receiving skills.

We’ve attended seminars, read books, heard talks until topics like nvc, active listening, etc. come out of our ears. But when the heat gets turned up, we tend to listen with the intent to reply and not to understand; we find that for all our good intentions, conflicts are still present in everyday life - even if they are swept under the carpet or overridden with appreciation exercises and team building games. In this session we want to take these tools and techniques and use them to open up perspectives in concrete conflict situations.  As with all tools and techniques, communication techniques are not a goal in themselves, they are a way of getting more information, of raising the level of abstraction, of finding opportunities to “change the game” and the atmosphere, of expanding the horizon of possible solutions, of building relationships in the midst of conflict.  So, in this session we will spend time practicing and applying some of those communication techniques and truths to analyse conflicts that participants bring to the session.  So… do not expect the silver bullet for communicating perfectly in conflicts, of solving all problems, of winning all your battles. Instead we invite you to come and bring along your favourite current conflict - and take a look at this conflict from different perspectives. Come and see if you can’t discover viewpoints and aspects that open up possibilities - all while practicing techniques and having fun.

Do you jump up in the early morning full of energy or do you revel in the atmosphere of evenings and late nights? And what do the people at your table have in common with you?&quot; The hour is comprised of a sequence of 5 moderated, low key games aimed at creating an opportunity to get to know and connect to the 5-6 others seated at your table - with no goal other than connecting and having fun. Do you remember the last time you met a stranger and you connected – totally unexpectedly and with no hidden agendas? Maybe it was on the subway… maybe at lunch break – but it made your day magical. This session is not about learning new techniques and practices – there are all the other sessions for that. It’s also not about just another icebreaker activity. It is also not about another one of those techniques to build trust and enhance team work.  So, take a step back from the bustle and join us for an hour of discovering differences and similarities - of laughing and being surprised - of seeing and being seen. Information for Program Team:  This session is comprised of a collection of low key &quot;games&quot; and &quot;activities&quot; meant to give people at conferences a chance to connet with people and get into conversations. Of course the breaks at confernces give opportunity for this - but they are often short -and people tend to talk to those they already know - or wander around. So the idea is to offer the opportunity for those who want it, to take a session and use it to connect. It is devised from the perspective of an introvert - who does not like a lot of the typical mixing games... it starts off with games that are rather low key and as the course of the games go, the level gets a little more personal while allowing people to stay at the level of confidence they feel comfortable with. There will be around 5 games in the course of the session, they are timeboxed for around the same times each - although the times might vary - sometimes they also vary for different table groups. We know this is a rather unusual session proposal - especially as the main benefit is not some skill that people can take away with them. But we think that it can be a valuable session to offer at a conference - since conferences are not only about sharing knowledge and experience, but also about networking. Certainly these games can be used as icebreakers in breaks or at evening events - but the previous experience also seem to indicate that it was particularly effective to have it as a session maybe because then the people who came, had taken the decision they wanted to be there, talking to people.","Marina Haase Marina Haase is a lawyer and mediator turned software developer and scrum master.

This very same diversity is the main resource of innovations and learning. A bad fight denies the need for diversity. How to help teams see the full potential of differences?  (2) Good fight won't externalize the root cause of a fight outside the involved persons. In a bad fight the involved persons tend to blame an unfortunate situation or a malicious person, and they won’t take responsibility of their own feelings or the consequences of the fight. How to develop culture of responsibility and intellectual honesty?  (3) Good fight increases trust and mutual appreciation. Bad fight destroys trust, and rarely - if ever - base on appreciation. How to build sufficient safety and trust for constructive fights?  (4) In a good fight reason and emotion are balanced. Behind a bad fight, there is often a presumption that the fight is only about the Truth - or only about emotions. How to help people to enter into a mindful dialog?  (5) Good fight is a fearless journey toward a bit more shared language and way of thinking. In a bad fight we often times expect the others to see and understand the world more or less as we do. How to build understanding without a shared language and worldview?  The intent of the talk is to provide tools and practices for more effective, mindful and constructive debate on crucial decisions.

Are code reviews painful? Are you blindly following orders from a backlog, or are you learning from observation?  Visual Thinking Strategies, or VTS, is a cross-disciplinary technique applicable to anyone working in a collaborative setting where observation is key. VTS develops critical thinking and communication skills by viewing and discussing works of art in a group. It is backed by over 30 years of field research showing its effectiveness and accessibility. By allowing individuals to talk about art - without needing a background in the field - VTS advances skills you can use to create more relevant products and stronger teams: Observing, Brainstorming, Speculating, Reasoning with Evidence, Cultivating a Point of View, and Revision & Elaboration.  During this interactive exercise, we’ll discuss selected works of art as a group. There are no right answers or group consensus being sought. We’re creating an environment and process for looking, thinking, reasoning and revision - skills that are mission-critical to anyone working in a software design or development role. After our group discussion, participants will learn the basics of image selection and facilitating VTS sessions within their own organizations. In addition to the above, we'll cover how VTS can help you and your team with the following: Comfort with Ambiguity, Openness to the Unfamiliar, Civil Debate, and Willingness to Participate in Group Thinking.","Alexandra West is an art director, production designer and international speaker.

With a complex physical limitation finding relevant information in order to maintain independence is vital.  These results are part of a research project undertaken by the Helen Hamlyn Centre for Design with Arthritis Research UK support.  Objectives The focus was on what level of information is needed to assist in the process of buying products relevant to arthritis.  Methods A co-design and double-diamond research methodology has been adopted. Interviews, observations and user testing have been carried out with thirty-four participants with OA, ranging from those newly diagnosed to people that have lived with OA for up to twenty years. All participants were over the age of fifty-five.   Results Variation in the level of detail the content shows as well as adaptation in the way information is provided can change the online shopping experience for people with arthritis issues. This can create a trusted environment where online shopping is not as restrictive and where the user does not require to buy multiple products at a time in order to compare how useful they are to their individual case.   Conclusions  The research has led to discoveries about the priorities of people living with arthritis in terms of what a product can help them with. The experience is very different for the user searching for products to assist daily living as compared with any other online shopping experience. There are barriers around trust, specifically in relations to the images used, as participants found that they are often confusing and they are not modelled by relatable people. There is a perceived inconsistency such as showing a product being used by younger looking hands which does not help a person with arthritis to identify it as an appropriate item. One solution may be the use of videos which are being explored in current research. Characteristics such as weight of a product is essential in this matter as well as easy to understand measurements and details relating to assembly and disassembly for cleaning purposes, but often even detailed descriptions lack, prohibiting the buyer from making make an informed decision.","Ela Neagu has a particular interest towards healthcare projects alongside investigating user experience and behavior within fields with sensitive information.

An outside in approach focusses on looking at your product from the view point of your customer/market.  It's important to spend the necessary time and effort to craft a compelling value proposition as it will form the basis of sales, marketing and product development efforts. It also helps differentiate your product from your competition.  This session is for product owners/managers in existing organisations that are looking for customer focussed techniques to invent and improve value propositions.  Have you been frustrated with any of the following:  Lack of a shared language and understanding of customer value creation Focussing on technologies, products and features instead of customers Spending time developing and debating ideas rather than testing them with customers and stakeholders The Value Proposition Canvas makes explicit how you are creating value for customers and is a tool that creates a simple and shared language to discuss value propositions across organisational boundaries.  It consists of two key blocks:  Customer Profile block - In this block you clarify your customer understanding by looking at what matters most to your customers - customer jobs, pains and gains. Value Map block - As part of this block, you explore how you plan to create value for your customer by describing products and services, pain relievers and gain creators. The best thing is that it is visual, practical and is easy to learn! It can be used by individuals or teams when creating a new product from scratch. It can also be used by teams for existing products, in order to improve or invent value propositions.  In this session, we will explore an existing product through the lens of the value proposition canvas and then create value proposition canvases for some of your products/ideas.","Annu Augustine is a product management expert.

While sulking about it, he realised that a lot of parallels could be drawn with how we develop software... in particular, how having lots of ""work in progress"" can seriously damage the flow of work through your development process.  -----  DRAFT SLIDES (hosted on my Google Drive): http://bit.ly/confkitchensinkwip  -----  Further info for programme committee:   In this talk I tell a humorous story about how my wife and I had a (genuine) argument about the washing up: she filled the sink with dirty fragile things, rather than washing one item at a time. This meant that there was a high amount of ""Work in Progress"", or ""WIP"", in the kitchen sink.   As the story develops, I discuss some (real-life) scenarios that then took place, proving that this high level of WIP was causing real issues, making more work and delaying things other people needed to do. These started with someone needing one of the unwashed items. We could have provided this sooner, and more easily, had we washed one item at a time. Next, someone needed to empty a pan of boiling water into the sink and we urgently had to abandon all of the WIP and put dirty items into the draining board.  As the talk develops, I discuss how this makes a good metaphor for software development. I explain how lower WIP helps us to deliver working elements of the software sooner using the first example from above. I then discuss how the pan of water is similar to a new requirement that could force you to abandon your work in progress, or rush it through to production too hastily (as we did with the dirty items on the draining board).   The talk aims to be entertaining as well as informative, with crudely-drawn pen drawings I made the day after the argument (I'm no artist!), my mock anger about the situation and the amusing level to which I have over-analysed this household scenario, before taking the (obviously rational) step of submitting the whole thing as a conference talk.   Having ran this as an internal blog post within Ocado Technology, I was also quite taken aback by how many people approached me to say ""I've had that argument, too!"". Hopefully the conference committee, and conference attendees, will also have experienced an equally frustrating situation!  (Note that I intend to further develop the draft - for example, to give teams more specific ideas on how to handle WIP in their process - subject to rehearsing the current version and measuring timings.)","Lawrence is a Software Engineer at Ocado Technology, helping thousands of vans to successfully deliver fresh groceries to customers' doors every day.

Data breach related headers appear daily in various news feeds.  Do you test the security of your applications? Are third party libraries that you use free from known vulnerabilities? Do you educate your developers about security? Do you monitor illicit activity in your apps? Do you know how to secure your constantly chainging software?  If most answears are No, then most probably security will bite you somewhere in the future. To prevent that i am going to provide general directions and ideas to consider in order to help you improve the overall security in agile approach to software development. We will cover aspects like security testing, education and monitoring. I will share fails and success stories as well as tips, tricks and resources which will help you armour you software and prepare for battle.","Mateusz is a Senior IT Security Consultant at SecuRing https://www.linkedin.com/in/molejarka  https://twitter.com/@molejarka  His key responsibilities are web and mobile application penetration testing, source code review.

Sketching helps with brainstorming ideas, iterating through concepts, and communicating your ideas to others. Whether working individually or in a group, your ability to sketch helps take the abstract ideas out of heads and into the real world. If you’re not comfortable sketching then there is little chance that your ideas will stick with you, your team members, and even your clients. Don’t worry—the confidence you need to put your pen to paper and start to sketch is close at hand! With the addition of a few simple approaches to your daily routine, you too can harness the power of sketching.","Rizwan is a User Experience Designer.

After all, the end-user has no idea how the software works and doesn’t care. All they do care about is to work fine. It turns out that software design is not userless.

We'll talk about the individual skills and ""mental stances"" that allow leaders to support an organizational Agile mindset. We'll talk about accountability, personal responsibility and the what it means to influence. Finally, we will challenge a few common assumptions on leadership and suggest alternatives.  # Long Description  The Agile world seems to have recently discovered the importance of ""leadership"". This can be very good news and it can also very bad news.  It's bad news if the so-called ""Agile Leadership"" is a way to rebrand traditional management models, along with their underlying mindset, so that they could survive in a rather different cultural ecosystem — namely, Agile.  On the other hand, this interest can be very good news if Agile Leadership is seen as something almost entirely new. Something tightly connected to Agile and, therefore, deeply rooted in complexity and empiricism. Something that carries a deep understanding of human dynamics in highly cooperative, intellectually intense social environments. Something that — last but not least — is equipped with a good deal of self-awareness, system-awareness and self-transcendence.   Modern and truly Agile organizations want and need to, among other things: explore and validate multiple options, not sticking to predefined plans; learn constantly, re-plan as needed; leverage the collective intelligence of their teams, for better exploration of options and smarter learning; have built-in resiliency when facing sudden change; getting results out of people's participation, not out of people's compliance.  In this sense the whole concept of true Agile Leadership is quite important indeed, because it's fundamental to nurture and support those organizations that really embody an Agile culture, and that are so far away from the ""organization as a machine"" approach that's so typical of traditional leadership and management disciplines.  Agile Leadership or, rather, the act of ""leading"" in Agile is so much different from those disciplines because it's inherently organic, meaning that it has influence and is influenced on a number of different levels in the individual and in the organization: on the personal level; on the collective level; on current behaviors; on future behaviors; on the social relationship level (trust); on the personal responsibility level (participation); on the formal responsibility level (accountability); on the motivational level and many more.   This richness and multidimensionality of the act of leading in Agile is such that simplistic mental models (such as the leader being the ""guy at the top"") simply won't suffice and therefore a more mature understanding and practice of leading is called for, in the entire organization.  In this talk we will discuss the case for Agile leadership, why we need it, what are the benefits to the organization and why it's different from other leadership approaches. We'll talk about the individual skills and ""mental stances"" that allow leaders to support an organizational Agile mindset. We'll talk about accountability, personal responsibility and the what it means to influence. Finally, we will challenge a few common assumptions on leadership and suggest alternatives.  The intent is to have the attendees leave the room with a fresh perspective on Agile leadership and with practical advice on how to enable this kind on leadership in their organizations.  The speaker has been working on Agile cultural shift for organizations for years, helping them to redesign their structures to be consistent with the Agile values, and has been working on Agile leadership well before it became a popular topic.  The presentation style will be mostly frontal, but the speaker will engage the audience with questions and discussions, making the session more interactive.","I help knowledge-based organizations, including IT companies, to rethink their organizational dynamics, their organizational structures, their mental models, their practices and their processes, to let them operate better in the 21st century.  I work closely with executives, managers and teams and I do a number of things including one-on-one coaching, team coaching, consulting on specific practices and, occasionally, hands-on training.  I’m especially interested in distributed leadership and self-organization for knowledge-based organizations, a topic that touches on a number on subjects, including non-conventional organizational structures and individual and collective communication and social skills.

M. Spayd and M. Hamman are talking about shifting from directive – ""managing for results"" leadership style to catalysing – ""designing environments that create results"" style. Lyssa Adkins recommends avoiding asking ”Why don’t you…?” questions when coaching, as being too offensive. Clean language methodology promotes better clarity of communication. All mentioned recommendations are excellent but they require changes in behavioural patterns, which is not easy to achieve. Additionally, they do not give complete answers on the following: how to discover dysfunctional behavioural patterns, why we are ending up in them in the first place and how to manage to avoid them?  I’ve found answers on these questions in Transactional Analysis (TA) theory, created by psychiatrist Dr. Eric Berne. I’m using TA as a tool for improving the dysfunctional communication. My main focus is on the ”games people play”. A game is a series of transactions between two or more people, which follow a predictable behavioural pattern, resulting in a predictable outcome. When we have understood these games, we can successfully break some of the ”bad” behavioural patterns.

This talk is about understanding the key factors and leadership style required to nurture learning organizations in order to boost business agility.  What comes to mind when you hear the word agile? Probably Agile software development methodologies like Scrum will come to mind. For everyone else in large organizations, however, the word suggests business agility. Leading for business agility It’s about understanding and nurturing the mindset needed to get an holistic understanding of agility.  As a result, the Scrum Alliance is expanding its mission. “Agile is now much more than a revolutionary approach to work for the software development industry, It’s transforming a wide variety of industries and specialties from marketing and human resources to financial services.” Manny Gonzalez, CEO of the Scrum Alliance.  I believe business agility is creating a learning organization that is every time faster and better at learning about themselves and their customers. We are creating a new generation of organizatios that gets its value from their learning capabilities. Therefore Leading to learn is critical to succeed in business agility.  The Manifesto’s focus on better software was what the industry needed at the time. “The Agile Manifesto was an awesome kickstarter from 2001, because we had this customization challenge, but now, we’re pushing to get the rest of the organization aligned. It’s not just about better software, it’s about better business.  We’re in a “customization revolution” where software drives business agility by helping companies focus on individual customer preferences. Customers don’t care about your product. They care about their needs, the product is a means of customer communication and delight, not the goal itself. An organization won’t be in touch with such preferences unless it is a learning organization.  As a Certified Agile Leadership Educator by the Scrum Alliance, I’ll share my thoughts about the key factors and leadership style required to nurture learning organizations in order to boost business agility.  This Leadership development framework called ""leader's dance-floor"" is the model that I use as center of my Scrum Alliance Certified Agile Leader training to support Agile leadership development at all levels.  outcomes Business Agility Leadership development Learning organizations Leader's dance-floor Enemies of learning and friends of learning according to Ontological coaching  structure I plan to run this session with a big circle of chairs and the framework will be drown in the center of the room with tape.  This session can be delivered as a 45min Talk + Framework exploration or as a 1hour workshop.  The session starts with a 15 min introductory talk and 3 exercises on the application of the framework. 1/ Discover Enemies of learning (10 min). 2/ Turn Enemies of learning into Friends of learning (10 min). 3/ Using the leader's dancefloor for personal leadership development (15 min). Closure and more examples of the leader's dancefloor usages for leadership development and exploration.  story This framework has been presented at a local Agile Chile Event, at the CST/CEC gathering during the last Global Scrum Gathering in Munich, ant at the Last Agile Spain conference CAS2016","Angel is a very energetic Enterprise Coach who truly enjoy challenges.

These tools also allow teams and organizations to set achievable objectives and ensure they don’t overload with too much change at once. •	Treatment: Those organizations experiencing ongoing resistance to behavioral or process change can use employee engagement techniques to involve people in the solution. We will go through one of the most effective tools to manage this resistance: the change network.  •	Preventive Care: If your organization is rife with rumors, confusion, or people feeling out of the loop, setting up strong ongoing communications is key to ensuring future changes go smoothly.

First, the talk will touch on why collaboration between these two often opposing groups is so important, and why designers should be able to write HTML and CSS.    Then, a few topics will be explored which play an important role in improving team collaboration:  - Language: Establishing a shared vocabulary & giving useful feedback - Documentation: Building a living styleguide, component guide & code documentation - Rules: Defining a common project structure, establishing a CSS naming convention & using code linters - Shared assets: Defining icons & components for reuse in future projects  Concrete examples from recent projects will be shown, which will illustrate why it is that important to establish a shared vocabulary and an integrated front end workflow.  After the talk, the viewers should understand that it is paramount that all documentation is auto built and not separated from the actual code base in order to guarantee that everything is up to date.

Although many believe there is a correlation between happiness and productivity, Agilists disagree on the effect that measuring team happiness has on the growth of teams. Some think the happiness metric could help increasing velocity significantly. Others state that this metric provides just a limited understanding of a team’s perception of their well-being, which makes it difficult to effectively use the metric for the team’s advantage.   The discussion on the happiness metric also shows how much people struggle with the measuring process itself. What questions do you ask to get an understanding of the Team Happiness? How frequently do you measure? How do you analyse and read the data? Inspired by one of the strongest proponents of the happiness metric, Jeff Sutherland, Agile Coach Nienke Alma decided to give it a try herself. With just a simple excel template and a good dose of enthusiasm she started to experiment with measuring team happiness in four teams.  After a few sprints, the data that the teams collected brought new inspiration. Apart from happiness trends, the data also seemed to provide insight in what motivates individual team members. Suddenly Daniel Pink’s “Drive” (the Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us) came into play. The team happiness measurements made visible that Autonomy, Mastery and Purpose were aspects influencing the happiness of the team members. Connecting the happiness metric of Sutherland with the three factors that motivate people of Pink added a whole new dimension to the team happiness measurement experiments. What if the happiness metric could help to influence the motivation of individual team members? Would that make them happier, and therefore the team happier? And would that have an effect on the team performance?","Nienke Alma is a people oriented Agile enthusiast with 9 years of experience as tester, test manager, Scrum Master, Agile trainer and coach. She is currently working as an Agile Coach at ING Bank in the Netherlands.  She has special interest in team dynamics.

For good reasons. There’s indeed much to say about effective Retrospectives, dos and don’ts of the Sprint Planning or the good practices of backlog refinement. Although the Scrum Framework has been introduced many years ago and organizations use the framework for a long time, we realize that we should continue learning in order to understand the essence of it.  The Sprint Review seems to be an exception. During conferences this event usually gets less attention than for instance the Sprint Retrospectives. Has the Sprint Review become such a routine in most organizations that we don’t need to talk about it anymore? Or do we consider this event as less important, resulting in a shifted focus to other subjects?  To be honest: none of the statements seem to be true. The events of the Scrum framework all have their own specific purposes, but they are equally important to achieve optimal results. There are still many organizations where we see suboptimal interpretations of the Sprint Review. We should not stop learning about Sprint Reviews. It’s about time to put the subject back on the radar!  In this workshop Nienke Alma will explore the subject together with you. Let's come up with a ""definition of awesome"" for Sprint Reviews and compare this definition with the reality of the Sprint Reviews currently done by your Scrum Teams. How do your Sprint Reviews score? What can you do tomorrow to close the gap?  Don't expect any slides. This interactive workshop will encourage continuous sharing of experiences and a good discussion.","Nienke Alma is a people oriented Agile enthusiast with 9 years of experience as tester, test manager, Scrum Master, Agile trainer and coach.

It felt like there was a sprint planning, stand up or retrospective meeting happening all the time.  We decided to take a hard look at how we were working and turn it on its head.  We looked at all the different agile options such as scrum, kanban, lean, xp, etc and decided to take the best part from all of these instead of sticking with one approach.

How those requirements are documented or expressed has a tremendous influence on the rest of the project. A great way to build software that meets real users' real needs and gets the project off on the right foot is to begin with user stories.  User stories are simple, clear, brief descriptions of functionality told from the perspective of a user. User stories in agile and Scrum development can be useful to either a user of the software or the customer of the software. These user stories can then become the product backlog of an agile or Scrum project.  The technique of expressing requirements as user stories is one of the most broadly applicable techniques introduced by the agile processes; and user stories can also be an effective approach on all time-constrained projects.  This workshop provides us with the knowledge and tools needed to identify and write effective and helpful user stories. We'll learn the six attributes all good stories must exhibit and guidelines for writing a better user story.

The traditional test artifacts are time intensive, bulky and their structure do not support agile approach of software development. When working in agile environment testers work in a highly compressed test execution cycles. The stakeholders always complain testing as a bottleneck and ask to cut down number of testing activities or time allocated for testing. If we spend too much time in documentation ,we might end up having very less time to do actual testing.  Documentation != testing  Testers can use smart techniques like Mindmaps to create lean test artifacts - from test plan to a test report. Lean test artifacts convey the same information using fewer details and less verbose. Lean test artifacts save tremendous amount of time involved in test documentation. When I say I am applying lean approach it means I am reducing waste and at the same time I am amplifying my learning. Mindmapping is a cognitive activity that triggers creative ideas and reduces waste by avoiding extensive formats for test documentation.  Test planning  While test planning, you can draw an initial Mindmap keeping in mind the list of tasks, schedules, tools, roles, responsibilities, milestones etc. Present the Mindmap and discuss it with your stakeholders. Modify the Mindmap if any changes are required. One thing you will love about mind maps is its flexibility to adapt to changes. All you might have to do is to add or remove a node/branch. This flexibility might not happen when you draw on a paper, but a mind mapping software assists any changes easily.  The final mind map shows you the scope of testing in one glance. This mindmap can be used as a blueprint and later converted into a plan. This ensures that no test activity is missed.  Test case design  Mindmaps are an efficient way of creating lean test cases. It reduces the time required for creating test cases yielding better results. Mindmaps are very easy to maintain and are flexible to changing requirements.  Draw branches from every user story/epic and associate all its functionalities as sub-nodes.Start adding test ideas/test case for each functionality.  I created a mindmap covering test ideas for the major functionality. My team started to expand the mindmap by branching out more and more test ideas. We kept adding new nodes when we found unique scenarios that uncovered the bugs during our test sessions. This drastically increased our test coverage.The final mindmap can be as the basis for test case document or it's cool if it's used as it is.  The best part of mind mapping is that you generate more ideas when drawing them. Collaborative mind mapping with the team gives you best results.  Link to the presentation: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1en6Ew0nC08pQ42_9sgxsP6lAyw7c5JxbbrdaYBYn_n8/edit?usp=sharing","I am Prashant Hegde, a passionate tester from India.

For example, legal/policy risk professionals whose jobs hinge on making decisions informed by accurate insights may be reluctant to trust a new startup that claims to predict, with over 94% accuracy, the likelihood of any bill becoming a law the second it’s introduced.  So how might we design for additional trust when users interact with the results of machine learning algorithms? In this presentation, Crystal Yan walks through a case study of how FiscalNote’s design and data science teams worked together to redesign the scores and build greater trust among its users, particularly as the company signed on more Fortune 500 clients and began winning awards including the Word Economic Forum's Technology Pioneer award.
