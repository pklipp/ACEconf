<h3>ACE! Conference Code of Conduct</h3>
<p>The ACE! Conference endeavors to create a safe space for sharing ideas where participants can interact in an environment of mutual respect. Behaviour that interferes with that goal will be addressed immediately.</p>

<p>Such behaviour includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, and nationality, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>

<p>Exhibitors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.</p>

<p>If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender, expulsion from the conference with no refund, and contacting law enforcement. The goal of any action taken by the organizers is not to punish, judge or shame, but to provide a safe environment for all ACE! attendees and speakers. However, if the behaviour constitutes a criminal offense, including but not limited to assault, threats of violence, or actions that may be categorised as hate speech, the police will be notified. Participants are expected to comply with staff requests, and may appeal to the conference organizer, Paul Klipp, whose decision in such matters will be final. In the event of an appeal, both parties will be given the opportunity to describe what they saw and heard and provide any other information that they feel is relevant and each may speak for as long as they require with the accused presenting last. They may answer any questions put to them, and then a final decision will be made. The interviews may be conducted separately at the request of either party.</p>

<p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately.</p>

<p>Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference.</p>

<p>The event is organized by Paul Klipp, president of Wawel Hill sp. z o.o..
Paul can be reached at: paul@wawelhill.com.</p>

<p>A phone number for reporting incidents will be posted here during the event: +48 697 363 888. The phone will be carried by Paul Klipp.</p>

<p>We expect participants to follow these rules at all conference venues and conference-related social events.</p>
